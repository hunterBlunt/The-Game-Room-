# The-Game-Room-


Client and software requirements:
The Gaming Room is the client and they want us to take their Android based game application and turn it into a web-based game that operates on multiple platforms. 

What did I do well in this:
I think the thing I am most proud of in this document and project overall is my work in laying out my recommendations for operating on a decentralized cloud-based system that will save the client money and save us stress. I even recommended an existing platform that the client can use and included the avg cost.

How did the doc help the coding process:
Creating a Software Design document really helped lay out the foundations of what I needed to create when coding. It showed me what the end result should look like and how I can reach that goal.

What would I change:
I think that I could have done a much better job describing the Domain Model. I feel like I did not go enough in-depth with the description and did not make it easy enough to read. It could have been a lot more fluid. 

User needs:
The first thing I did when trying to interpret the user's needs and implement them was to break down what the client was asking for. They said they wanted it on multiple platforms. I read that as, "Ok, how can I design my software around that need? What is required for each OS (linux, Apple, Windows)?"

Designing software Approach:
I feel my approach to this project was, "Take large bits and force it down". Next time I design software I am definatly going to take care of a lot smaller pieces of the design. This will allow me to quickly chip away at chunks of the project and come back to things easily. An "agile" approach if you will.
